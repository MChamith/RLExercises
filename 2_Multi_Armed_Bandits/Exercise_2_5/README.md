### Exercise 2.5

Design and conduct an experiment to demonstrate the
difficulties that sample-average methods have for nonstationary problems. Use a modified
version of the 10-armed testbed in which all the q*(a) start out equal and then take
independent random walks (say by adding a normally distributed increment with mean 0
and standard deviation 0.01 to all the q*(a) on each step). Prepare plots like Figure 2.2
for an action-value method using sample averages, incrementally computed, and another
action-value method using a constant step-size parameter, ↵ = 0.1. Use " = 0.1 and
longer runs, say of 10,000 steps.
