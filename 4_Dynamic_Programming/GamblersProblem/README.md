### Exercise 4.7

Implement value iteration for the gamblerâ€™s problem and
solve it for ph = 0.25 and ph = 0.55. In programming, you may find it convenient to
introduce two dummy states corresponding to termination with capital of 0 and 100,
giving them values of 0 and 1 respectively. Show your results graphically, as in Figure 4.3.
Are your results stable as theta -> 0?
